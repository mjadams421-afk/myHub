  <h2><strong>Traffic knowledge</strong></h2>
    <h4>Signals vs. Roundabout</h4>
      <p><strong>_Signals shall only be used if passing traffic signal warrent from MUTCD.
      Signals shall consider vehicles and pedestrians. *It is possible to have a signal
      where no warrents pass as long as reasoning is documented.</strong>
      <em>studies should use 15 min. analysis for VPH.</em></p>
      <p>Only be used if traffic study determines overall safety improvement.
      Only be used if will not conflict with any safety conflicts.
      Should consider volumes of left/right turning vehicles.</p>
      <p><em>_Signals are the primary solution for heavy traffic at intersections
      greater then 45,000 AADT
      </em></p>
      <p>_A roundabout can only accomadate ~1,000 vphpl. 
      If multiple lanes are needed then carefull design vehicle turning analysis is
      to be done, in addition to the appropriate ROW. </p>
      <p><em>_Signals are a huge benefit where there is a large number of left turning vehicles.
      e.x. interchanges and large collecters like supermarkets & office blocks.
      </em></p>
     <h4>Other Controls</h4>
      <P>No Control: All approaches are minor roads. Traffic volume
      less than 1,000 AADT. Arroxamitely 90^ turning.</P>
      <p>Yield Control: Upgrade from no control if 2 or more crashes
      last 12 months. Less than 1,800 AADT or 140 vph. Anytime yielding
      to the ROW for pedestrians of cars.</p>
      <p>Minor Stop Control: Restricted view requires vehicles to Stop
      in order to have proper departure site from minor approach. 3 or more
      crashes in previous 12 months. Lower class road advancing on to higher class
      road require stop control.</p>
      <p>All-Way Stop Control: </p>
      <p> Refrences: The satisfaction of a warrent and engineering judgement.
      Typical use for similar high traffic volumes on all approaches 300vph major
      and 200vph minor for and 8 hours of a day.
