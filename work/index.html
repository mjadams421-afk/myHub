 <p>Transportation infastructure is a process of research and design. Tansporation needs
 are constantly changing requiring new designs for future infastructure.</p> 
 <p>Elements of design are: traffic control, roadside safety, speed, capacity,
 pavement density, roadway drainage, soil compaction and soil bearing capacity,
 design and oversized vehicles, ADA compliance, pedestrian safety, construction costs and maitenance costs,
 construction safety, local demographics, traffic generators, population flux, state and federal funding, etc. </p>

 <!--Trafic Control Design-->
 <divA id="traffic">
  <h2><strong>Traffic Control</strong></h2>
    <h4>Signals vs. Roundabouts</h4>
      <p><strong>_Signals shall only be used if passing traffic signal warrent from MUTCD.
      Signals shall consider vehicles and pedestrians. *It is possible to have a signal
      where no warrents pass as long as reasoning is documented.</strong>
      <em>studies should use 15 min. analysis for VPH.</em></p>
      <p>Only be used if traffic study determines overall safety improvement.
      Only be used if will not conflict with any safety conflicts.
      Should consider volumes of left/right turning vehicles.</p>
      <p><em>_Signals are the primary solution for heavy traffic at intersections
      greater then 45,000 AADT
      </em></p>
      <p>_A roundabout can only accomadate ~1,000 vphpl. 
      If multiple lanes are needed then carefull design vehicle turning analysis is
      to be done, in addition to the appropriate ROW. </p>
      <p><em>_Signals are a huge benefit where there is a large number of left turning vehicles.
      e.x. interchanges and large collecters like supermarkets & office blocks.
      </em></p>
     <h4>Other Controls</h4>
      <P>No Control: All approaches are minor roads. Traffic volume
      less than 1,000 AADT. Aprox. 90<sup>^</sup> turning.</P>
      <p>Yield Control: Upgrade from no control if 2 or more crashes
      last 12 months. Less than 1,800 AADT or 140 vph. Anytime yielding
      to the ROW for pedestrians of cars.</p>
      <p>Minor Stop Control: Restricted view requires vehicles to Stop
      in order to have proper departure site from minor approach. 3 or more
      crashes in previous 12 months. Lower class road advancing on to higher class
      road require stop control.</p>
      <p>All-Way Stop Control: The satisfaction of a warrent and engineering judgement.
      Typical use for similar high traffic volumes on all approaches 300vph major
      and 200vph minor for and 8 hours of a day. </p>

 <!--Geometry Design-->
 <divB id="geometry">
  <h2><strong>Roadway Geometry</strong></h2>
   <h4>Design Vehicles</h4>
    <p>All roadways must be designed to accomidate the design vehicle
    for the designated road class. All roadways must be designed for
    the potential of an oversized vehicle from a near by higher class road.
    </p>
   <h4>Pedestrians</h4>
    <p>Must be ADA complitant with average age of location. Must analyse 
    area to see if special accomidations are needed for handicaped, elderly or children 
    [e.x. limited: desicion making, hearing, sight and spatial awarenes]. Look 
    for pedestrian generators in the local area and type of pedestrian from it.</p>
    <p>Must have controls in place to have sufficent time to cross <mark>[gap=1/Q]</mark>.</p>
    <h4> Roadway Alignment </h4>
    <p> The centerline and lane width of the road must be tested. A driver height of 3.5 ft [driver in a car] and target sight 2 ft [car tail lights] 
    is used as variables of testing sigth distance of vehicles. These variables are used with an assumption of a dec. 11.2 ft/s<sup>^2</sup>
    [breaking deceleration on a wet surface].</p>
    <p> A <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Fundamentals_of_Transportation/Vertical_Curves" target="_blank"> Vertical Curve design</a> is solved by finding the speed, 
    starting elevation, point of intersection and ending elevation. The curve is analysed for vertical clearence [usually ~18ft of clearence] at any overpass or underpass point. 
    Using a curves algebraic difference in grades and radius can find length of curve using appropriate stopping sight distance. </p>
    <p> A <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Fundamentals_of_Transportation/Horizontal_Curves" target="_blank"> Horizontal Curve design</a> is solved by finding the speed, horizontal sight offset 
    and vertial evelvation change. The curve is analyzed to find how much superelevation <em>e%</em> is needed 
    at the curve. Using e% max and speed can find the length of the curve using appropriate stopping sight distance.</p> 
    <h4>Guard Rail</h4>
    <p> If the roadside has a BRW from the travel lane of less than (1:4 slope fill or 1:3 slope cut) then 
     no guard rail is needed. However for a high volume of vehicles and pedestrians 
     a guard rail may be used for overall safety. 
    </p>
    <p> For a roadside with greater than (1:4 slope fill or 1:3 slope cut) a guardrail must be considered. 
    </p>
    <p> Beyond the slope alone there are immediate hazards like bridge columns, bodies of water and nearby cliffs. These harzords could 
    easily result in death if struck. In this case guard rail for these situations are required.
    </p>
 </divB>
 <!--Lane Design-->
 <divBA id="lane">
  <h2><strong>Lane Design</strong></h2>
  <h4>storage</h4>
   <p>All lanes must be designed to hold the capacity of traffic volumnes. 
    The lane must be long enough of hold the demand of the peak hourly traffic. The que storage for a turning lane is found from 
    the following: less than 10% trucks is 2 minutes for vehicle volume using 18' vehicle and 6' space between. 
    More than 10% trucks is 2 minutes for vehicle volume using alternating 74' truck, 18' vehicle and 6' space between. </p>
    <h4>Lane Width</h4>
    <p> Lane widths vary based on the operation of the road. For one-way turning lanes [ramps] the width 
     can be much wider <em>over 20'</em>. Usually a shared lane which accomidates bicyclists is <em>arround 15'</em>. 
     If there is a turck volume greather than 2% then a through lane width of <em>min. 12'</em> should be used. Otherwise 
     a travel lane width can be <em>as low as 10'</em> and be fully operational.</p>
    </p>
    <p>Included with lane widths are the shoulder widths. Shoulder widths 
    are not part of the vehicle travel width, so they are part of the clear zone width. 
    A shoulder min. width starts at 2' and increases with greater AADT. A wide shoulder allows 
    vehicles to manauver if there is a hazard. A wide shoulder prevents traffic from stopping and allows 
    drivers to have greater horizontal sight distance for turning lanes. </p>
    </p>

 </divBA>
 <!--Speed Design-->
 <divC id="speed">
  <h2><strong>Speed Design</strong></h2>
  <h4>Speed Analysis</h4>
   <p>Speed Design is a ballace of <mark> Speed[V=miles/hour] vs. Density[K=veh/mile]</mark></p>
   <P>Important analysis of density is spacing <mark>[1/K=miles/vehicle]</mark>. Converting this to
   ft/veh is <strong><mark>[1/k]*5280<em>ft/mile</em>.</mark></strong> This is used for micro analysis
   of a roadway's level of service.</P>
   <p>Another ballance is <mark>Speed[V=miles/hour] vs. Flow[Q=veh/hour]</mark>.</p>
   <p>Important analysis flow is <mark>gap[1/Q=hours/veh]</mark>. Converting this to
   sec/veh is <strong><mark>[1/Q]*3600<em>sec/hour</em>.</mark></strong> This is used for analysis in pedestrian
   crossing times across a roadway.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>conversion <mark>[miles/hour]*1.47=[ft/sec]</mark></p>
   <p>Pedestrian speed is ~3.5 - 5 ft/sec or 2.5 - 3.5 miles/hour.</p>
   <p>Low speed vehicles are slower than 45<em>miles/hour</em> or 66<em>ft/sec</em>. High speed vehicles
   are equal to or greater than this. Urban or low speed residential is
   typically equall to or less than 25<em>miles/hour</em> or 37<em>feet/sec</em>.</p>
   <br>
   <p>Speed should be measured where vehicles are not affected by trffic control devices. 
    Gathering the <strong>Operating Speed</strong> for an area is found by finding the 85th percentile
    from a sample of cars from off-peak hours [outside the design hour volume or peak hour of traffic 
    for the day]. This gives an accurate average speed for the area.
   </p>
   <br>
   <h4>Speed Safety</h4>
   <p> Injuries are diectly related to a vehicles speed. Injury severity can be documented from <a href="https://www.aaam.org/education-resource-center/public-position-statements/abbreviated-injury-scale-ais-position-statement/" target="_blank"> [AIS] scale </a></p>
   . A crash report and cause of accident are used to determine reason for crash. <em>*A crash can happen based on many varriables: impared operator, operator failure, 
   vehicle failure, speeding, sight distance is inadaquate, etc. *A road design error requires a significant amount of evidence 
   to prove it is not another reason.</em></p>  
   <p> Most crashes are operator errors. Measures can be taken to help prevent future crashes caused by an operator: law enforcement, speed bumps, warning/enforcement signs,
   public education, etc.</p>
   <br>
   <p>Generally speaking the faster a vehicle moves the less time an operator has time to react. The average perception-reaction time is ~2.5<em>seconds</em>, 
   so for a vehicle traveling at 30mph <em>44.1 fts</em> that is ~110 ft for an average perception-reaction time. Then for 55mph <em>80.85 fts</em> the distance is doubled to ~202 ft
   for an average perception-reaction time. <em> A distracted,impared or drunk driver will have a longer perception-reaction time.</em></p>
 </divC>
 <!--Special considerations-->
 <divD id="special">
  <h2><strong>Special Considerations</strong></h2>
  <p>Using an advance stop bar can prevent a multiple-threat crash. This occurs when
  a dirver can not visibly see a crossing pedestrian b/c of blocked sight from another
  vehicle. [Ususally happens at 2 through lanes in a midblock crossing]. </p>
  <img src="multiple_threat.png" alt="traffic conflict" width="500px" height="auto"/>
  <br>
  <p>All design considerations should give prefrence to pedestrian crosses. This includes 
  crossing thru lanes, driveways, turning lanes, workzone areas, etc. </p>
  <img src="peds_pref.png" alt="pedestrian crossing" width="500px" height="auto"/>
  <br>
  <p>Curb ramps are a very important consideration for ADA compliance. There are multiple 
  design criteria for curb ramps: Align curb with crosswalk, 5% landing max grade, 2% cross slope, etc. </p>
  <img src="curb_ramp.png" alt="curb ramp" width="500px" height="auto"/>
  <br>
  <p> Increasing median width will generally increase the safety of motorists.
  <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/humanfac/93046/index.cfm" target="_blank">FHA median width research.</a>
  </p>
  <p> Greater median widths will also help pedestrian creating a refuge space and 
  improving overall road safety. </p>

 <!--Further Technical-->
 <divE id="furtherTech">
  <h2><strong> Further Technical </strong></h2>
  <h4><a href="spaceA.html" target="_blank">Electromechanical Information</a></h4>
 <p>There is also an Electromechanical side to the technology used in transportation infastructure. 
 This is used for management of power as a utility. </p>
  <h4><a href="spaceB.html" target="_blank">Roadway Drainage</a></h4>
 <p>Roadway drainge requires analysis of an area's drainage history. Drainage is simply preserving the roadway
 material and making travel safe by efficently removing water and preventing errosion.</p>
  <h4><a href="spaceC.html" target="_blank">Pavement Science</a></h4>
  <p> Pavement Science is the knowledge of pavement materials. Typically there are 2 main 
   pavements Asphalt Concrete (AC) and Conctrete. It is the knowldge of how & when to apply a specific pavement and 
   how to repair and analyze the condition of pavement.</p>
 </divE>
 <!--Planning-->
 <divF id="planning">
  <h2><strong>Economic Planning</strong></h2>
  <p>The science of using the most efficent construction model that minimizes valuable resources.</p> 
  <br>
  <h4> Types of cash flow analysis equations</h4>
  <p> There are several types of cash flow analysis equations: </p>
  <p> Most basic is Benefit to Cost <em><mark>[B2-B1]/[C2-C1]</mark></em>. This 
  shows if plan 2 has a greater benefit than plan 1. If plan 2 is B2 and C2. Then 
  Plan 1 is B1 and C1. Whichever plan has a greater value in the 2 spot is 
  the more benefical plan. This can also be used to compare proposed to existing 
  2 is proposed and 1 is existing. <em>Generally if solved equation is > 1 than 
  2 spot is beneficial.</em><strong> Benefits: reduction in costs for injuries and death, 
  reduction in cost of delay and reduction is cost of carbon tax. Costs: Cost of construction. </strong>
  </p>
  <p> Equivalent Uniform Annual Cost [EUAC]<em> Use <a href="https://global.oup.com/us/companion.websites/9780199339273/pdf/Appendix_C_CITables.pdf" target="_blank">intrest rate chart</a> with A/P using i=intrest rate 
  and n=number of years.</em> The present cost P is found as the present cost of construction. The annual cost is used when comparing to models 
  of a different life span. An important part of annual cost is capital cost <em> <mark>CA = [EUAC]/i</mark></em> which gives the amount needed to invest 
  at the beginning of the timeline in order to get recieve an annual return at the cost of the annual payments.
  </p>
  <p> Present Worth Method <em> Use <a href="https://global.oup.com/us/companion.websites/9780199339273/pdf/Appendix_C_CITables.pdf" target="_blank">intrest rate chart</a> with P/F or P/A using i=intrest rate 
  and n=number of years.</em> Present worths can be compared if using the same life span. A present worth can be found using a future cost [going back into the past] 
  or an annual cost [finding present worth from annual net payments/benefits].
  </p>
  <h4>Planning Strategy</h4>
  <p> The strategy of selecting the right plan comes down to the details of the schedule. </p>
  <p> Selecting an efficent schedule comes down to using a <a href ="https://www.hsecontractors.com/critical-path-method/what-is-cpm-schedule/" target="_blank">CPM Schedule</a>. 
  With a CPM schedule a plan can be devised where model is using an efficent amount to resources. A CPM also 
  determines the life span of the construction project which is crucial in a cash flow analysis.</p>
