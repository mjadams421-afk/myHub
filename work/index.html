 <p>Transportation infastructure is a process of research and design. Tansporation needs
 are constantly changing requiring new designs for future infastructure.</p> 
 <p>Elements of design are: traffic control, roadside safety, speed, capacity,
 pavement density, roadway drainage, soil compaction and soil bearing capacity,
 design and oversized vehicles, ADA compliance, pedestrian safety, construction costs and maitenance costs,
 construction safety, local demographics, traffic generators, population flux, state and federal funding, etc.

  <h2><strong>Traffic Control</strong></h2>
    <h4>Signals vs. Roundabouts</h4>
      <p><strong>_Signals shall only be used if passing traffic signal warrent from MUTCD.
      Signals shall consider vehicles and pedestrians. *It is possible to have a signal
      where no warrents pass as long as reasoning is documented.</strong>
      <em>studies should use 15 min. analysis for VPH.</em></p>
      <p>Only be used if traffic study determines overall safety improvement.
      Only be used if will not conflict with any safety conflicts.
      Should consider volumes of left/right turning vehicles.</p>
      <p><em>_Signals are the primary solution for heavy traffic at intersections
      greater then 45,000 AADT
      </em></p>
      <p>_A roundabout can only accomadate ~1,000 vphpl. 
      If multiple lanes are needed then carefull design vehicle turning analysis is
      to be done, in addition to the appropriate ROW. </p>
      <p><em>_Signals are a huge benefit where there is a large number of left turning vehicles.
      e.x. interchanges and large collecters like supermarkets & office blocks.
      </em></p>
     <h4>Other Controls</h4>
      <P>No Control: All approaches are minor roads. Traffic volume
      less than 1,000 AADT. Arroxamitely 90^ turning.</P>
      <p>Yield Control: Upgrade from no control if 2 or more crashes
      last 12 months. Less than 1,800 AADT or 140 vph. Anytime yielding
      to the ROW for pedestrians of cars.</p>
      <p>Minor Stop Control: Restricted view requires vehicles to Stop
      in order to have proper departure site from minor approach. 3 or more
      crashes in previous 12 months. Lower class road advancing on to higher class
      road require stop control.</p>
      <p>All-Way Stop Control: The satisfaction of a warrent and engineering judgement.
      Typical use for similar high traffic volumes on all approaches 300vph major
      and 200vph minor for and 8 hours of a day. </p>

  <h2><strong>Roadway Geometry</strong></h2>
   <h4>Design Vehicles</h4>
    <p>All roadways must be designed to accomidate the design vehicle
    for the designated road class. All roadways must be designed for
    the potential of an oversized vehicle from a near by higher class road.
