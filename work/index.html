 <p>Transportation infastructure is a process of research and design. Tansporation needs
 are constantly changing requiring new designs for future infastructure.</p> 
 <p>Elements of design are: traffic control, roadside safety, speed, capacity,
 pavement density, roadway drainage, soil compaction and soil bearing capacity,
 design and oversized vehicles, ADA compliance, pedestrian safety, construction costs and maitenance costs,
 construction safety, local demographics, traffic generators, population flux, state and federal funding, etc. </p>

 <!--Trafic Control Design-->
 <divA id="traffic">
  <h2><strong>Traffic Control</strong></h2>
    <h4>Signals vs. Roundabouts</h4>
      <p><strong>_Signals shall only be used if passing traffic signal warrent from MUTCD.
      Signals shall consider vehicles and pedestrians. *It is possible to have a signal
      where no warrents pass as long as reasoning is documented.</strong>
      <em>studies should use 15 min. analysis for VPH.</em></p>
      <p>Only be used if traffic study determines overall safety improvement.
      Only be used if will not conflict with any safety conflicts.
      Should consider volumes of left/right turning vehicles.</p>
      <p><em>_Signals are the primary solution for heavy traffic at intersections
      greater then 45,000 AADT
      </em></p>
      <p>_A roundabout can only accomadate ~1,000 vphpl. 
      If multiple lanes are needed then carefull design vehicle turning analysis is
      to be done, in addition to the appropriate ROW. </p>
      <p><em>_Signals are a huge benefit where there is a large number of left turning vehicles.
      e.x. interchanges and large collecters like supermarkets & office blocks.
      </em></p>
     <h4>Other Controls</h4>
      <P>No Control: All approaches are minor roads. Traffic volume
      less than 1,000 AADT. Aprox. 90^ turning.</P>
      <p>Yield Control: Upgrade from no control if 2 or more crashes
      last 12 months. Less than 1,800 AADT or 140 vph. Anytime yielding
      to the ROW for pedestrians of cars.</p>
      <p>Minor Stop Control: Restricted view requires vehicles to Stop
      in order to have proper departure site from minor approach. 3 or more
      crashes in previous 12 months. Lower class road advancing on to higher class
      road require stop control.</p>
      <p>All-Way Stop Control: The satisfaction of a warrent and engineering judgement.
      Typical use for similar high traffic volumes on all approaches 300vph major
      and 200vph minor for and 8 hours of a day. </p>

 <!--Geometry Design-->
 <divB id="geometry">
  <h2><strong>Roadway Geometry</strong></h2>
   <h4>Design Vehicles</h4>
    <p>All roadways must be designed to accomidate the design vehicle
    for the designated road class. All roadways must be designed for
    the potential of an oversized vehicle from a near by higher class road.
    </p>
   <h4>Pedestrians</h4>
    <p>Must be ADA complitant with average age of location. Must analyse 
    area to see if special accomidations are needed for handicaped, elderly or children 
    [e.x. limited: desicion making, hearing, sight and spatial awarenes]. Look 
    for pedestrian generators in the local area and type of pedestrian from it.</p>
    <p>Must have controls in place to have sufficent time to cross [gap=1/Q].</p>

 </divB>
 <!--Speed Design-->
 <divC id="speed">
  <h2><strong>Speed Design</strong></h2>
   <p>Speed Design is a ballace of Speed[V=miles/hour] vs. Density[K=veh/mile]</p>
   <P>Important analysis of density is spacing [1/K=miles/vehicle]. Converting this to
   ft/veh is <strong>[1/k]*5280<em>ft/mile</em>.</strong> This is used for micro analysis
   of a roadway's level of service.</P>
   <p>Another ballance is Speed[V=miles/hour] vs. Flow[Q=veh/hour].</p>
   <p>Important analysis flow is gap [1/Q=hours/veh]. Converting this to
   sec/veh is <strong>[1/Q]*3600<em>sec/hour</em>.</strong> This is used for analysis in pedestrian
   crossing times across a roadway.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>conversion [miles/hour]*1.47=[ft/sec]</p>
   <p>Pedestrian speed is ~3.5 - 5 ft/sec or 2.5 - 3.5 miles/hour.</p>
   <p>Low speed vehicles are slower than 45<em>miles/hour</em> or 66<em>ft/sec</em>. High speed vehicles
   are equal to or greater than this. Urban or low speed residential is
   typically equall to or less than 25<em>miles/hour</em> or 37<em>feet/sec</em>.</p>
 </divC>
 <!--Special considerations-->
 <divD id="special">
  <h2><strong>Special Considerations</strong></h2>
  <p>Using an advance stop bar can prevent a multiple-threat crash. This occurs when
  a dirver can not visibly see a crossing pedestrian b/c of blocked sight from another
  vehicle. [Ususally happens at 2 through lanes in a midblock crossing]. </p>

  <br>
  <p>All design considerations should give prefrence to pedestrian crosses. This includes 
  crossing thru lanes, driveways, turning lanes, workzone areas, etc. </p>
  <img src="peds_pref.png" alt="pedestrian crossing" width="500px" height="auto"/>
  <br>
  <p>Curb ramps are a very important consideration for ADA compliance. There are multiple 
  design criteria for curb ramps: Align curb with crosswalk, 5% landing max grade, 2% cross slope, etc. </p>

 </divD>
 <!--Further Technical-->
 <divE id="furtherTech">
  <h4><a href="spaceA.html" target="_blank">Electromechanical Information</a></h4>
 <p>There is also an Electromechanical side to the technology used in transportation infastructure. 
 This is used for management of power as a utility. </p>
  <h4><a href="spaceB.html" target="_blank">Roadway Drainage</a></h4>
 <p>Roadway drainge requires analysis of an area's drainage history. Drainage is simply preserving the roadway
 material and making travel safe by efficently removing water and preventing errosion.</p>
