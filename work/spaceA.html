  <!--Electron Science-->
 <divA id="electron">
  <h2><strong>Electron Science</strong></h2>
  <P>An <strong><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/electron" target="_blank"> electron</a></strong> is a negatively charged subatomic particle.
  An atom with more or less electrons needed to be balanced is called an Ion. An Ion atom 
  will move elctrons/atoms to be balanced again. Electrons in a free state with no pull of a Proton are called Plasma Electrons.</P>
  <p>Subatomic particles are too small to count individually, so for simplicity <strong>1 coulomb [C] = 6.242X10^18 electrostatic unit [esu]</strong>.</p>

 <!--Electrical Power-->
 <divB id="power">
  <h2><strong>Electrical Power</strong></h2>
  <p>Uderstanding Electrical power needs to be broken up into several steps: </p>
  <ol>
   <li>Knowing the difference between <a href="https://www.ecoflow.com/us/blog/ac-vs-dc-current" target="_blank"> AC vc. DC Current</a> is essential. 
   Simply put AC current has a changing polarity [changing direction] over time causing a current [e.x. generator]. While 
   DC current has a constant polarity [one direction] over time causing a current [e.x. battery].</li>
   <li>Knowing the fundamental equations is critical to analysing a circuit. The most basic is finding the resistive force of a circuit
   in OHM's: <strong><a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-physics/chapter/20-3-resistance-and-resistivity/" target="_blank"> R = [p x l]/ A </a></strong>. After
   that the most common equation is OHM's law for finding voltage: <strong><a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/chpt-2/voltage-current-resistance-relate/" target="_blank"> 
   V = I x R </a></strong>. The last fundamental equation is calculating power from Joule's law: <strong><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Joules-law" target="_blank"> P = I x V <em>or</em> P = I^2 x R</a></strong> <em> .7457 KW/HP </em> </li>
   <li>Next step is knowing the difference between a <a href ="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/chpt-5/what-are-series-and-parallel-circuits/" target="_blank"> <strong> Simple circuit</strong> and a <strong>Parallel circuit:</strong></a>
   A <strong>Simple circuit</strong> <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/chpt-5/simple-series-circuits/" target="_blank"> has voltage equivalent be adding voltage and Resistnace is added to an equivalent resistive force </a><strong> Ve = I x Re </strong>. 
   For this reason a voltage divider can be used to measure resistance <strong> V2 = V x [R2 / [R2 + R1]] </strong>. A <strong>Parallel circuit</strong> <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/chpt-5/simple-parallel-circuits/" target="_blank"> have a current equivalent by adding current and resistance equivalent by adding conductive </a><strong> V = Ie x Re</strong>. 
   For this reason a current divider can be used to measure resistance <strong> I2 = I x [R1 / [R1 + R2]]</strong>. </li>
   <li> Afterwards it is impotrant to know about <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/alternating-current/chpt-5/review-of-r-x-and-z/" target="_blank"><strong> Impedance [Z], Resistance [R] & Reactance [X]: </strong></a>
   These terms are used for AC circuits. The phase anlge of a <em> Sine wave </em> is found to determine effiencey <strong>X = Z x sin[phi]</strong>. Impedance and Resistance is found the same way in a <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/alternating-current/chpt-5/series-r-l-and-c/" target="_blank"> Simple circuit </a>
   and a <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/alternating-current/chpt-5/parallel-r-l-and-c/" target="_blank"> Parallel circuit </a>. </li>
  </ol>

  <h2><strong>Electrical Machines</strong></h2>
  <p>Knowing how common electrical machines work is important knowledge when analyzing a system.</p>
  <li>
   <ul>
    <strong><a href="https://www.maddox.com/electrical-transformers" target="_blank">Transformer:</a></strong> a machine that uses coils arround 2 magnetically permeable cores. 
    The number of windings on the first core[primary-Np] and second core[secondary-Ns] determines how the transformer changes the voltage. A step up in voltage means 
    Np less than Ns then voltage increases and is a step up. It is assumed power is conserved from Np to Ns as P=IV. Therefore a step up transformer 
    will have and increase in voltage with a decrease in current [common transformer going to a building].
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <strong><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/three-phase-generator" target="_blank">Polyphase Generator</a></strong> is usually a 3 stage generator that has 
    <a href="https://genserveinc.com/2022/08/10/pros-and-cons-of-3-phase-vs-single-phase-generators/" target="_blank">3 sinusoidal voltage signals</a> seperated 120^. 3 phase generators allow 
    smaller conductors than 1 phase of the same power output. They are also more efficent and output a more uniform torque. 
    The <a href="https://testbook.com/electrical-engineering/torque-speed-characteristics-of-induction-motor" target="_blank">Torque vs Speed</a> of a generator is governed by important elements. 
    <em>Breakaway tourque</em> is the torque needed to come out of static rest. <em>Pull up torque</em> is the torque needed to accelerate from start up. <em>Breakdown Torque</em> is the torque 
    value that causes the engine to stall out [important when accelerating to synchrouns speed]. The <em> Full Load torque</em> occurs at a low steady state toruq value; this occurs a synchrouns speed. 
    Synchronous speed occurs at n[rpm] = 120*f[Hz]/P[# of magnetic poles].

 <h2><strong> Key Design Conditions </strong></h2>
  <h4>Right-of-way</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> 30' - 50' from edge of travel line</li>
    <li> Not impact any other utilities like drainage</li>
    <li> Be deep enough to prevent a subsurface survey b/c of post and barrier depth</li>
    <li> Not be located under pavement or in medians</li>
    <li> Not comprimise sight clearence of bridge load rating</li>
    <li> Whenever possible avoid alternatives which require utility facility relocation</li>
    <li> Always give ample prior notice before utility work</li>
  </ul>
   <h4> Highway Lighting</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> Use the appropriate lamp size for the mounting height</li>
      <li> Luminaire spacing is found through an equation using variables for lamp lumens, road utilization, roadway width, etc.</li>
      <li> Use breakaway transformers base unless in high pedestrian urban area or base is shielded</li>
      <li> Aviod placing poles near a gore, underpasses, or signs; in order to prevent shadowing effect</li>
      <li> If primary power source is insufficent then use a transformer to step up voltage</li>
      <li> Wire, Conduit, Pullboxes, Junction Boxes and Photoelectric Control shouls all be accounted for</li>
      <li> The lighting report should include all hardware, lighting area, luminare & pole locations, voltage w/ wiring details, pole foundation and roadside cutt/fill lines</li>
    </ul>
