 <h2><strong>Hydrology</strong></h2>
 <p><a href="https://www.usgs.gov/water-science-school/science/what-hydrology" target="_blank">Hydrology</a>
 is the science of water moving in an enviroment [water cycle, rivers, streams, etc.]. 
 The flow of water over a watershed can reach a point of
 peak discharge where the maximum flow is occuring in a point in time. A graph called a 
 Hydrograph is used to determine this point in time from a watershed area.
 </p>
 <p> Rainfall is an important part in the water cycle and in drainage. Rainfall is measured in inches per hour <em>[in/hr]</em>
 A Hyetograph measures the point in time where rainfall is the most intense. Flow of water 
 over a paved surface past 300' will become a channel flow. From a channel flow you can calculate velicty in feet/seccond over pavement by
 [V=20.3282 X sqrt(<em>slope as a decimal</em>)]. The time of channel flow is time[secconds] = distance[feet]/velocity[feet/seccond].
 The time or time of concentration can be used to contruct the point in time of peak flow in a hydrograph. <em>Time of concentration should be at 6 minutes as a min.</em> </p>
 <p>
  The <a href="https://www.lmnoeng.com/Hydrology/rational.php" target="_blank">Rational Equation</a> is a very simple equation used to find 
  the peak discharge in a watershed up to 200 acres. The simple equation is used as a basis for more complex equations and 
  more complex drainage systems.

 <h2><strong>Fluid Mechanics</strong></h2>
  <P> <a href="https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Civil_Engineering/Fluid_Mechanics_(Bar-Meir)/00%3A_Introduction/1.1%3A_What_is_Fluid_Mechanics%3F" target="_blank">Fluid Mechanics</a> is the study of fluids 
  under ststic and dynamic forces. This is a very large topic and is broken up into two major sections <a href="https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_Engineering/EGR_1010%3A_Introduction_to_Engineering_for_Engineers_and_Scientists/14%3A_Fundamentals_of_Engineering/14.11%3A_Mechanics/14.11.03%3A_Hydraulics/14.11.3.01%3A_Hydrostatics" target="_blank">Hydrostatics [not in motion]</a>
  and <a href="https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Civil_Engineering/All_Things_Flow_-_Fluid_Mechanics_for_the_Natural_Sciences_(Smyth)/06%3A_Fluid_Dynamics" target="_blank">Fluid Dynamics [fluid motion]</a>. 
  A knowledge of all Fluid Mechanics is important when analyzing drainage. </P>
  <p> There are a few very important concepts in Fluid Mechanics related to drainage. <strong><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/hydraulic-radius" target="_blank">Hydraulic radius</a></strong> is the ratio of the 
  area in flow due to adhesion and friction of the water to a wetted surface R=A[ft^2]/P[ft]. This is important for finding mean velocity in 
  a channel which is used to find flow rate Q=V[ft/sec] X A[ft^2]. <strong>Uniform Flow</strong> is used because water is incompressible, therefore flow rate at one end 
  of a system equalls the flow rate at the other end Q1 is Q2. From the uniformity equation comes the <a href="https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/University_Physics/University_Physics_(OpenStax)/Book%3A_University_Physics_I_-_Mechanics_Sound_Oscillations_and_Waves_(OpenStax)/14%3A_Fluid_Mechanics/14.08%3A_Bernoullis_Equation" target="_blank">Bernoulli's Equation</a> which states that 
  energy is conserved and the equation can be used to find change in pressure, elevation, speed, etc. From Bernoulli we can use the <a href="https://geo.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Sedimentology/Introduction_to_Fluid_Motions_and_Sediment_Transport_(Southard)/05%3A_Open-Channel_Flow/5.04%3A_Energy_in_Open-Channel_Flow" target="_blank">Specific Energy diagram</a> to determine if the flow is 
  subcritical or supercritical. Generally we would want slightly subcritical because to flow is more stable and less 
  likely to cause erosion from high velocity at the surface of a wetted perimiter. Lastly there is the <stong><a href="https://blog.fluidflowinfo.com/friction-losses-and-the-reynolds-number/" target="_blank">Friction Factor</a> which is uses Reynolds nomber to determine if the 
  flow is laminar or turbulent. If the mean veolicty and the wetted surface area is high a flow can become turbulant. A turbulant flow is much harder to 
  calculate the friction and is thus very non efficent. From the calculated friction you can use <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/hydraulic-grade-line" target="_blank">Energy Grade Line</a> to calculate loss from friction. Friction loss 
  will be due to a lower Specific energy from the other end of a pipe. Specific energy is the depth of flow d[ft] and mean velocity V[ft/s]. Channel elevation Z[ft] is included in the total headloss hL[ft], but is not a headloss dut to friction.

  <h2><strong>Drainage Design</strong></h2>
  <p> There are a lot of analysis tool for studying water as a resource. 
  The amount of information can quickly become overwhelming to the point where a 
  water resource specialist is unable to come to a decision. 
  </p>
  <p> A designer can follow these important areas to narrow down their decision. <strong> Lower the fluid velocity when possible</strong>. <em>Think 
  of high velicty as high blood pressure</em>. High velocity causes damage to the pipe/channel material and the enviroment from erosion & deterioration. 
  To prevent this designers should consider the min. slope of 0.5% and min. speed of 2-4[ft/s] to achieve <em>self cleansing</em>. <strong>Know the locations history and environment</strong>. Every location 
  is different. Some areas will have more rainfall, more acid in their water, more snowfall, different soil, different temperatures etc. These differences in location 
  will affect the erosion and deterioration rates differently. A designer should choose materials, structures and pumps knowing when they should be maintenced based on the locations history and environment.
  <strong> Know the locations usage of water.</strong> Based on a specific location the people may use water differently. In a desert they would need a resevoir, and depending if there is farms or not 
  they may need more water than is needed just for the population. In a developed forest area they would need a lot of drainage to stop flooding that would prevent 
  access or mobility. In an area with little popultation and little transit travel a designer may decide to use simple drainage methods like stone filling to minimize maitnence because anauall flooding is permisable.
